# Media Utilities

This section documents **media-related utilities** in ReaxKit.
These helpers handle **visualization, plotting metadata, and presentation-layer glue**
used across workflows, without embedding scientific or file-format–specific logic.

The goal of the media utilities is to keep **plotting and visual output consistent**
across the entire toolkit.

---

## Scope of `utils/media`

Utilities in this folder typically deal with:

- Plot configuration and defaults
- Axis labeling and units
- Figure saving and export conventions
- Lightweight visualization helpers shared across workflows

They are intentionally **analysis-agnostic** and **file-agnostic**.

---

## Typical responsibilities

### Plot configuration

Media utilities often centralize:

- Figure size and DPI defaults
- Font sizes and label styles
- Consistent axis labeling rules
- Legend placement conventions

This ensures that plots generated by different workflows
look coherent and publication-ready by default.

---

### Axis and label helpers

Common helpers include:

- Mapping internal column names → human-readable labels
- Appending units to axis labels
- Normalizing time / frame / iteration labels

These are frequently used together with:
- `utils.convert`

---

### Save and export helpers

Media utilities may also handle:

- Safe figure saving (respecting user-provided paths)
- File format selection (`png`, `pdf`, `svg`)
- Avoiding overwriting existing figures
- Printing clear messages about saved outputs

---

### Movie generation (`make_movie`)

In addition to static figures, the media utilities also support **movie generation**
via a helper commonly exposed as `make_movie`.

This utility is used to convert a **sequence of rendered frames** (images or matplotlib figures)
into a video file.

---

## How media utilities fit in the stack

Typical workflow flow:

1. Workflow parses CLI arguments (`--plot`, `--save`)
2. Analysis computes numerical results
3. Media utilities:
   - configure the figure
   - label axes
   - render plots
   - save or display output

This separation keeps workflows thin and avoids duplicated plotting logic.

---

## What media utilities should *not* do

Media utilities should not:

- Load or parse ReaxFF files
- Perform scientific calculations
- Encode assumptions about specific file formats
- Contain workflow-specific branching logic

Those responsibilities belong elsewhere.
