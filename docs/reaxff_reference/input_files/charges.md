# `charges` file — Fixed atomic charges for ReaxFF

The **`charges`** file defines **fixed atomic charges** for use in ReaxFF simulations.

When the keyword:

```
icharg = 5
```

is set in the [control](control.md) file, ReaxFF disables geometry-dependent charge models and instead reads **static charges** from the `charges` input file.

---

## Purpose of the `charges` file

Using fixed charges can:

- Improve **simulation stability** during early equilibration
- Reduce **computational cost** compared to dynamic charge models
- Enable controlled comparisons with non-reactive force fields

However, fixed charges **do not adapt during reactions**, which may lead to **unphysical results** in highly reactive simulations.

---

## File handling

- The `charges` file is copied by the `exe` script to **`fort.26`**
- ReaxFF reads fixed charges exclusively from `fort.26`
- The filename `charges` itself is not read directly by ReaxFF

---

## File structure overview

The `charges` file is organized by **molecule types**, allowing multiple identical molecules to share the same charge definition.

### General layout

1. Number of molecule types  
2. Molecule index ranges for each type  
3. For each molecule type:
   - Molecule identifier (comment line)
   - Number of atoms
   - Atom number–charge pairs

---

## Example 2.15: `charges` file

The following example defines fixed charges for a system containing:

- **5 methane molecules** (molecules 1–5)
- **5 water molecules** (molecules 6–10)

```text
2   ! Number of molecule types (format i4)

1 5 6 10   ! Molecule type definition (format 20i4)

Methane   ! Molecule 1 identifier
5         ! Number of atoms in molecule 1

1 -0.4800 ! Atom number; charge (format i4,f10.6)
2  0.1200
3  0.1200
4  0.1200
5  0.1200

Water     ! Molecule 2 identifier
3         ! Number of atoms in molecule 2

1 -0.8200 ! Atom number; charge
2  0.4100
3  0.4100
```

## Keyword and field description

### Number of molecule types

```
2
```

Specifies how many **distinct molecule charge templates** are defined.

---

### Molecule type definition

```
1 5 6 10
```

Defines which molecule indices correspond to each molecule type:

- Molecule type 1 → molecules **1–5**
- Molecule type 2 → molecules **6–10**

---

### Molecule identifier

A comment-style label identifying the molecule type:

```
Methane
Water
```

Used for readability only.

---

### Atom charges

Each atom charge entry specifies:

```
<atom index> <charge>
```

- Atom indices must match the atom ordering in the geometry file
- Charges are given in **elementary charge units (e)**

---

## Practical notes

- The `charges` format is well suited for systems with **repeating molecular motifs**
- Fixed-charge definitions can often be generated by:
  - Running a short ReaxFF simulation with dynamic charges
  - Extracting averaged charges from **`fort.56`**
- Fixed charges may:
  - Improve numerical stability early on
  - Become inaccurate once reactions or charge transfer occur

---

## When to use fixed charges

**Recommended**
- Initial equilibration
- Weakly reactive or non-reactive systems
- Benchmarking performance

**Use with caution**
- Reactive chemistry
- Charge-transfer dominated processes
- Long production MD runs

---

## Summary

- The `charges` file enables **fixed-charge ReaxFF simulations**
- Activated via `icharg = 5` in the `control` file
- Copied to `fort.26` by the `exe` script
- Powerful for equilibration and speed, but limited for reactive accuracy
