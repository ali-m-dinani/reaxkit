# ReaxFF Output Files Reference

This directory documents the **output files generated by ReaxFF**
during molecular mechanics (MM), molecular dynamics (MD), and
force-field (FF) optimization runs.

The table below summarizes the most common output files, the type of run
in which they appear, and their purpose. Detailed explanations for the
more complex files are provided in the accompanying markdown documents
in this directory.

## Notes

- **`NAME`** refers to the structure identifier defined in the `DESCRP`
  field of the input geometry.
- **`####`** indicates the iteration number, typically controlled by
  `iout2` or `iout6`.
- Control keywords such as `iout1`, `iout2`, `iout6`, `cutof2`,
  `cutof3`, `icheck`, and `idebug` are defined in the **control** file.

## How to Use This Directory

- Files that are **format-identical to input files** (e.g. `.geo`, `.bgf`)
  are not re-documented in detail.
- Files with **complex structure or diagnostic value** (e.g. `fort.7`,
  `fort.71`, `fort.73`, `fort.99`) have dedicated markdown files in this
  folder.
- This reference is intended to support both **raw ReaxFF users** and
  **ReaxKit analysis workflows**.

If you are using ReaxKit, many of these files are parsed automatically
by dedicated handlers and analyzers.
